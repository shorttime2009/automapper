# automapper

hi !

thanks for using my auto mapper,
first of all, lets start with basics, download the automapper by clicking on "source code"

now, extract the file downloaded

download python from this microsoft store (microsoft store is better for this program)
then, type "cmd" in the path text bar

then, type ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

wait for it to install, u can install FFMPEG while the requirements download, check this link to download it : https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#repositories (watch a tutorial to install the FULL ffmpeg version, if you install the source code it wont work)

tutorial video for ffmpeg installation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyIIvctDhYc

now, go back on your terminal and write ``python randomapV4.py``

and enjoy ! :D

(dont mind the RIFF error when the map is done generating, just ignore it)
